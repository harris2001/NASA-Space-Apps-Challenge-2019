Firstly, we interpret the 3D objects as multiple 2D images. These images are then used as samples to a probability distribution.  To fix any wholes in these images, we need to gain as much information as we can from the context in the missing area and also to develop an artificial perception of the image as a whole. We use an "approximation" technique to approach and recover any missing parts from the image.
