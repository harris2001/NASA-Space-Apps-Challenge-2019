# NASA-Space-Apps-Challenge-2019
A complete repository for my project "Guessing Master" for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2019 

## The Idea:

3D printing is one of the most prominent technologies that humanity will need so that to evolve by collect more information about the vast universe. The gigantic 3d printers that will be sent to exoplanets can exploit the raw materials located there so that to create new satellite telescopes and more printers that can either orbit the exoplanet or continue their travel further away. The capabilities of this 3d-printer-satellite network can be tremendous! The development of such a web can give an exponential rise to our perception of this bizarre universe. To have this web up and working, 3d object models must be created on Earth and then to transmit them to the net.

## The problem:

Sending these data to a machine seven to a hundred or even trillion light-years away needs the analogous time.  Background radiation and any radiation originating from the space disrupt and add noise to the data sent.  Moreover, while sending or receiving the data, any component malfunctions on the printer or the station can create holes in the object. Since there is no excess of time available or capital, an intelligent machine has to be created, so that to supervise the process from the beginning.

## The solution:

Guessing master is a complete model, ready to be trained by million of NASA's 3d object models so that to be able to provide the printer with the best approach to the original model sent by the station/the ground.

## How does it work:

The "Master" is a system of two Neural Networks: one Neural Network 
Firslty, the "Master" performs a Fast Fourier Transformation on the data received by the printer. The frequencies are then separated and the object becomes more clear. Afterthen, the master
